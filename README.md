### Building From Source

See [ElastiBuild](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-installers/wiki/ElastiBuild)

---

**NOTE**: *Building from source should only be done for development purposes. Only the officially distributed and signed Elastic Stack Installers should be used in production. Using unofficial Elastic Stack Installers is not supported.*

## Installing to a custom location
The default target folder for the MSI is typically something like `c:\Program Files\Elastic\Beats\<version>\<beat>` eg. `c:\Program Files\Elastic\Beats\8.12.0\winlogbeat`.

Starting version 8.13 It's also possible to override the installation folder by executing the MSI from command line as such:
`msiexec /i "<full path to msi file>" INSTALLDIR="<path of custom folder>"`

Few important notes:
- For security reasons, it's recommended to keep the installation folder "Program Files"
- An empty folder will always be created at the default location `...\Beats\<version>\<beat>` to a known limitation as explained [here](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp/issues/790).
- Custom installation folder is not applicable for Agent MSI (only beats)

## Agent

In case of problems during install / uninstall of agent, please refer to the [Capturing Logs](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-installers/blob/agent_support/README.md#capturing-logs) section which will enable troubleshooting.

### Install
During the install flow, The MSI installer will unpack the contents of the MSI to a temp folder and then will call the `elastic-agent install` in order to:
1. copy the files to the final destination at `c:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent`
2. register the agent as a windows service
3. enroll the agent into fleet

In order to complete step 3 above, the MSI installer shall receive command line arguments, passed with INSTALLARGS command line switch followed by `"`, for example:
```
elastic-agent.msi INSTALLARGS="--url=<fleet_url_with_port> --enrollment-token=<token>"
```

Note that the MSI will call the `elastic-agent install` command with `-f` (force) to avoid user interaction.

### Uninstall
Similarly to the install flow (described above), the MSI will call the `elastic-agent uninstall` command, and it's possible to pass arguments using `INSTALLARGS`. One common use case is uninstalling an agent which has tamper protection enabled.

### Upgrade
The Agent MSI doesn't support upgrade. Since the agents are fleet managed, upgrades shall be done using fleet (UI / API).
