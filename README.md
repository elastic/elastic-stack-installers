## Bumping version

### After a patch release

Update version in `Directory.Build.props` in the branch for the related minor version (ex: https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-installers/pull/183).

### After a minor release

1. Create a branch for the next minor release from the main branch
2. Update the main branch:
    - Bump version in `Directory.Build.props`
    - Update `catalog-info.yaml`:
      - Add a new daily schedule for the new minor branch
      - Remove the daily schedule for the previous minor branch
    ex: https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-installers/pull/156 and https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-installers/pull/172
